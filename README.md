# Polytech ARM-based embedded processor

## üìã Instructions we had to follow

By using [Logisim](proc/logisim/), we firstly had to make a [CPU](proc/) (a simplified one) which can run binary files (machine code). You can find how to convert Clang files into Assembly files in the next section. Next, we had to make [a program](asm/) which can translate assembly language (ARMv7) into machine code.

You can learn more about Logisim, ARMv7 and the whole Cortex-M0 family of processors in the [docs](docs/) folder.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compile C to ARM Assembly using the CPU

To check whether our CPU works or not, we need to compile these C programs and compare each other.

Install the `libc6-armel-cross`, `libc6-dev-armel-cross`, `binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi` and `libncurses5-dev` packages by using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install clang libc6-armel-cross libc6-dev-armel-cross binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi libncurses5-dev
```

Then, install `gcc` and `g++` to support ARM:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi g++-arm-linux-gnueabi
```

Finally, you can compile like this:

```bash
clang -S -target arm-none-eabi -mcpu=cortex-m0 -O0 -mthumb -nostdlib -I./include main.c
```

Please, note that the `./include` folder (which contains the headers) should be in the same directory of the `main.c`.
You can see some examples in the [c](c/) folder.
